                If u have ever walked down your local street and noticed a giant pothhole in front of your
                path, or seen waterlogged streets in mild rains and ever wondered on how these problems
                often get overlooked, you are not alone! We at UdevCIty share your thought on how many everyday problems
                arent actively acted upon. We believe that the reason on why a problem is not solved is that our
                collective voices may not reach the concerned authorities. To tackle this issue we present a solution,
                UdevCity! A team of brilliant minds brought together with a common ambition-using the network to help
                solve problems and make sure that the problems faced by individuals everyday reach the concerned
                authorities. The name "UDevCity" comes from the simple
                expression on how "U" can play a part in the "dev"(development) of your "City". We are a private
                organisation, not linked to any government or other private organisation in any manner.

            <div class="head">Why?</div>
            <p class="para">
                Our aim is "Development". There are many problems and issues faced regularly by people, that are usually
                viewed as small and arent well tended to. Hence, most people tend to ignore them altogether. UdevCity
                takes the initiative to make sure that issues are always reported to the concerned authorities.
                Eliminating all problems of all sorts and sizes is the only way to a healthy environment. As responsible
                members of this society, it is our duty to try and help the authorities in every way we can and achieve
                the coveted Smart City title.

                the rest. Sounds easy right? Our team is actively working on
                sorting all types of reported problems and then making sure they reach the concerned authorities. If u
                have ever wondered "Who to report to", "How does the process work" or anything like that, with us on the
                scene u wont need to worry anymore. Your voice will always reach the concerned ears.
